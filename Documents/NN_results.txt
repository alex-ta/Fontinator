# Notes about the results

- All nets wehere trained with ~3000 images per font (0.2 test data, 0.8 training data)

## NN
- Examples (LT2)
- Converge very slow (500-1000 epochs; 17h)
- Can train without batches (all images per epoch)
- Saved model ~500mb

## CNN
- Example (ConvLong)
- Converge very fast (~10 epochs; 1h)
- Requires smaller batch sizes for training (max 500 images). If batch size greater -> memory overflow
- Saved model ~200mb

## Pro and Contra
+ Work with whole sentences and single characters
+ Works with different text paddings
- Very bad results for images with random noise (Accuracy 10-20%)

## Possible improvements
- Train with images that have random noise
- Preproces images before prediction (filters)
