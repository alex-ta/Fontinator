# Image Creator

To use the creator call the createImg.py script.
You have to enter information over prompt to trigger the creation process. 
The script needs no arguments.
1) Filename that contains a set of sentences (essay)
2) Folder that contains some fonts (nothing else)
3) image width of all created images
4) image height of all created images

Now the magic happens 
The script calls toImage.py [args]
The files get created in a subfolder that contains all fonts
